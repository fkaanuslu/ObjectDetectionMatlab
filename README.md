# ObjectDetectionMatlab
Capture a photo using your smartphone camera that includes at least 5 different objects positioned at varying distances and angles from the camera. Without changing the camera angle, shift the camera 5 cm to the left and take a second photo. Then do segmentation, find bounding boxes, centroids, pixel displacement, disparity and plot them.
